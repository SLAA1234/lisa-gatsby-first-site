***Shinichi Kudo*** (工藤 新一 Kudō Shin'ichi?) is the high school detective, narrator and main protagonist of the manga and anime Detective Conan. While on a date with his childhood friend (later girlfriend) Ran Mouri, Shinichi encounters two men from a secret criminal organization who force feed him a strange poison that causes his body to shrink back to first grade age. Shinichi takes up the alias Conan Edogawa and plans to use his immense skill as a detective to make Ran's bumbling private detective father famous in hopes that he will find a case involving the secret organization so he can expose its crimes and acquire an antidote that will turn him back into a teenager.

Viz romanized his original name as Shin'ichi Kudo.

### Intelligence

While only in high school, his passion mysterious have lead him to be a very well-read to showcase advanced knowledge and understanding in a myriad of subjects, which he can methodically use to aid him in investigations.

He has a keen understanding for criminal psychology, occasionally being able to sense if someone is the true criminal. He can also predict movement and plan of the criminals, and in some cases, he used this skill to "bluff".
